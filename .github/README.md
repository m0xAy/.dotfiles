# .dotfiles

This setup uses a 'bare' respository to track configuration files, rather than symlinks and scripts.

It follows [this idea](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071754) shared by StreakyCobra (referenced in this [blog post](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles)).

The alias `dot` is used to perform Git operations on this repo (this is defined in `~/.zshrc` once cloned).

### Setup

In Terminal run this [script](https://gist.github.com/m0xAy/ed64d1631c417cb476cb959050996638):

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/m0xAy/ed64d1631c417cb476cb959050996638/raw/8bf877cc92d40cb972d01261235cdf85168fadae/setup.sh)"
```

It's fairly self-explanatory, you can see what will be installed by visiting the link above.

Once complete, you should be able to close Terminal and open [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)ðŸ¤ž.
